{"name":"Chrome-angular-template","tagline":"a template for mobile apps in android, ios, and chrome backed by a yeoman angular project","body":"Generic Chrome Mobile Angular Application\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\nThis is a generic app framework that can run as a standalone webpage, a chrome extension, an android app, or an ios app.  It provides many common visual conventions, including a pinned navbar, a slide out side menu, and dismissable cards.\r\n\r\n![A generic Chrome App running as a Chrome Extension](https://github.com/infomofo/chrome-angular-template/raw/master/docs/images/ChromeExtensionSlideNav.png)\r\n\r\n![A Generic Chrome App running as an iOS application](https://github.com/infomofo/chrome-angular-template/raw/master/docs/images/iPhoneAppSlideNav.png)\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIn addition to basic application scaffolding, this repo provides various common mobile application behaviors, provided by some external plugins.\r\n\r\n1. Special thanks to @sthomp for his [angular-slidenav.js](https://github.com/sthomp/angular-slidenav.js) project - the nav is pictured in the demo pictures above.\r\n2. A module for detecting online status is used to display an alert when your device does not have network service.  This is provided by [angular-online-status](https://github.com/infomofo/angular-online-status).\r\n3. A module for caching any externally referenced images in chrome local storage for offline access and persistence across device sessions is provided by [angular-chrome-image-storage](https://github.com/infomofo/angular-chrome-image-storage)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to \r\n\r\nHow to use this repo\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nAt some point this will be a yeoman template or something, until then you can:\r\n\r\n1. Clone this repo and delete the .git directory\r\n2. Update the application name in www/manifest.mobile.json\r\n3. Update the application name in bower.json and package.json\r\n4. Follow the steps below to get the boilerplate app working. \r\n\r\nFirst time Setup\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n### Setting up tools\r\n\r\n1. run ``npm install -g yo`` to install yo, grunt-cli and bower\r\n2. run ``npm install -g cca`` to install the chrome mobile utility\r\n3. run ``export PATH=/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH`` to ensure command line access to modules. \r\n4. run ``cca checkenv`` to ensure your machine is set up for mobile development.  If not this will instruct you on how to get Xcode and android development environments initialized for use with cca.\r\n5. run ``npm install -g ios-deploy``\r\n6. run ``npm install -g ios-sim``\r\n\r\n### Setting up the repo after cloning for the first time\r\n\r\n1. run ``npm install`` to initialize node modules\r\n2. run ``bower install`` to initialize bower dependencies\r\n3. run ``cca pre-prepare`` to initialize cordova plugins\r\n4. run ``cca platform add ios`` to add ios platform to project\r\n5. run ``./initializePlugins.sh`` to initialize plugins\r\n\r\n\r\n### Copying settings from chrome extension to android app\r\n\r\nRun this the first time, and any time after you make modifications to the ``www`` directory.\r\n\r\n1. run ``cca prepare`` to initialize the platforms directory with ios and android applications\r\n2. run ``./copySplash`` to copy splash screens from ``www/res`` to the platforms directories - this is currently not handled by cordova\r\n\r\nStandalone web app\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n### Running the web application\r\n\r\n1. grunt serve\r\n\r\nChrome extension\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe chrome extension is the easiest to modify and debug.\r\n\r\n### Running the chrome app\r\n\r\n1. In your chrome browser, enable chrome developer flags at ``chrome://flags`` and enable \"Experimental Extension APIs\"\r\n2. Go to Tools -> Extensions\r\n3. Load Unpacked Extension- navigate to ``./www``\r\n\r\n### Debugging the chrome app\r\n\r\nThe chrome app can be debugged with the standard \"Inspect Element\" debugger in a chrome web browser.\r\n\r\nAndroid\r\n-------\r\n\r\n### Running the android app\r\n\r\nThe android app can be run in an emulator, which can be installed with brew\r\n\r\n1. run ``brew install android`` to install the android toolkig\r\n2. run ``android`` to download packages and set up an avd device.\r\n\r\nTo run the android on an emulator or connected device\r\n\r\n1. Attach an android device in debug mode, or run the android avd emulator.\r\n2. if you are running on a connected device you can verify first with ``adb devices``\r\n2. run ``cca run android``\r\n\r\n### Debugging the android app\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\nIOS\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Running the ios app\r\n\r\nThe ios app can be run in an emulator, which can be installed via xcode.  It can only be installed on devices with a valid provisioning profile, which requires a paid apple developer account.\r\n\r\nTo run on a emulator\r\n\r\n1. run ``cca emulate ios``\r\n\r\nTo run on a connected device (requires provisioning)\r\n\r\n1. run ``cca run ios``\r\n\r\n### Debugging the ios app\r\n\r\n1. Run Xcode\r\n2. Open ``./platforms/ios/*.xcodeproj``\r\n3. Click Run\r\n\r\n### Debugging the ios app in safari\r\n\r\n1. At the command line run ``defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeDebugMenu 1`` (you only need to do this once)\r\n2. Launch the app in the emulator\r\n3. Launch safari \r\n4. Connect to the Iphone Simulator in the Develop menu\r\n\r\nExtending the application\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n### adding new javascript dependencies\r\n\r\n1. Find a module with ``bower search <search term>``\r\n2. Install it and save it to your bower.json file with ``bower install <javascript module> --save``\r\n\r\n### adding new plugins\r\n\r\n1. ``cca plugin add <plugin name``\r\n2. ``cca pre-prepare``\r\n3. ``cca prepare``\r\n\r\nFile documentation\r\n------------------\r\n### Project files\r\n* **``README.md``** This file\r\n* **``bower.json``** A list of all json dependencies.  _Do not modify directly_.  Add new dependencies with ``bower install <dependency name> --save`` \r\n* **``config.xml``** A config file for cordova.\r\n* **``www/``** All of the actual content of the app is contained in this directory\r\n\r\n  * **``index.html``** The skeleton of one-page application mostly just contains javascript and css imports.  Very little modifications should be made to this, other than new bower dependencies or css.\r\n  * **``manifest.json``** Defines how the chrome app will be packaged, including identifiers, oauth behaviors, permissions, icons, and version name.\r\n  * **``background.js``** Defines the behavior of the chrome app, including the landing page, and the window size of the chrome extension (does not affect ios or android).\r\n  * **``assets/``** Contains icons that will be used to represent the app\r\n  * **``bower_components/``** Contains external javascript and css dependencies brought in by bower.json.  Should not be version controlled or modified directly- make all modifications to ``../bower.json`` using ``bower install --save``\r\n  * **``images/``** Contains all packaged images used by the application, i.e. logos.\r\n  * **``res/``** Contains resources used by the packaged apps, such as splash screens (TBD).\r\n  * **``scripts/``** Contains all angular scripts and javascript objects used by the application\r\n    \r\n    * **``app.js``** Contains the definition for the main angular app\r\n    * **``controllers/``** Contains controllers for various parts of the application\r\n    \r\n  * **``styles/``** Contains custom stylesheets for the application    \r\n    * **``main.css``** Common css for the application\r\n    * **``nav.css``** Styling related to the top nav\r\n    * **``sidenav.css``** Styling related to the side nav\r\n  * **``views/``** Contains different screens for the application\r\n  \r\n    * **``main.html``** The landing page that the user first sees\r\n\r\n### Files not kept in version control\r\n\r\n* ``platforms/*`` These files are generated by cca prepare\r\n* ``plugins/*`` These files should be generated with cca plugin install as they vary by machine\r\n* ``node_modules/*`` These files are generaetd by npm install\r\n* ``www/bower_components/*`` These files are generated by bower install","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
